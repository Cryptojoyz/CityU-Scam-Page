# JPEX Fraud Case

## Introduction
In September 2023, Hong Kong revealed a massive fraud case involving the virtual asset trading platform JPEX. This company, claiming to be legitimate and regulated, used false promises of high returns and a complex pyramid scheme, resulting in significant losses for over 1,600 investors, with the involved amount reaching 1.2 billion HKD. This case not only highlights the high risks of virtual currency investments but also sparks extensive discussions on financial regulation.

## Case Background
JPEX was established in 2020, claiming to be a global digital asset encryption trading platform. The scam was jointly planned by the company's founder Mr. Li, financial manager Mr. Zhang, and technical director Mr. Wang. Through extensive advertising and endorsements from well-known KOLs Lin Zuo and Chen Yi, they successfully attracted a large number of investors. JPEX claimed its platform coin JPC could provide high returns and encouraged investors to purchase and stake JPC in large quantities.

## Fraud Process

**1. Initial Promotion**
- **Advertising and Promotion**: JPEX invested heavily in advertising on various media channels, claiming that its platform coin JPC offered high-return investment opportunities. The attractive advertisements drew significant attention.
- **KOL Endorsement**: KOLs like Lin Zuo and Chen Yi used their public influence to frequently post successful investment cases on social media, showcasing high returns and attracting a large following and investor base.

**2. Attracting Investment**
- **False Promises**: JPEX claimed its platform coin JPC could achieve high returns in a short period, enticing investors to purchase and stake JPC in large amounts. Investors were drawn by the high-return promises and invested significant funds.
- **Unlicensed Operations**: Despite not having obtained a license from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), JPEX misled investors by portraying itself as a legitimate platform. The SFC had been monitoring the virtual asset sector since 2017 and listed JPEX as an unlicensed company in July 2022, yet JPEX continued its illegal operations.

**3. Operational Tactics**
- **High Returns**: Initially, some investors did receive high returns, further attracting more people to invest. However, these early returns were actually paid using funds from later investors.
- **Increased Fees**: After the SFC issued warnings, JPEX raised the withdrawal fee to $999, with a withdrawal limit of only $1,000, effectively restricting investors from withdrawing their funds. Many investors found themselves unable to withdraw smoothly, growing suspicious of the platform.
- **Shutting Down Trading**: During the police investigation, JPEX abruptly shut down the financial page and halted all transactions, preventing investors from accessing and retrieving their funds.

**4. Case Exposure**
- **SFC Warning**: On September 13, 2023, the Hong Kong SFC issued a warning statement, pointing out that JPEX was unlicensed and operated suspiciously. The SFC particularly noted JPEX's aggressive promotional tactics and found serious issues with its operational model.
- **Police Action**: On September 18, 2023, Hong Kong police launched a large-scale operation code-named "Iron Gate," searching multiple JPEX offices and arresting eight people, including Lin Zuo and Chen Yi. During the operation, the police found large amounts of cash, valuable jewelry, and documents related to JPEX.

## Investigation and Arrest
Police and the SFC held a joint press conference, revealing details of the case. As of that time, the police had received 1,641 reports, with the involved amount reaching 1.187 billion HKD. The police stated that JPEX used advertising, media, OTC exchanges, and KOL promotions to attract investors to register and trade on the platform, effectively controlling users' assets by managing their private keys.

## Detailed Character Analysis
1. **Mr. Li**: Founder and CEO of JPEX, mainly responsible for planning the entire fraud scheme and overseeing the overall strategy and direction.
2. **Mr. Zhang**: Financial manager of JPEX, in charge of managing the company's funds, ensuring the smooth transfer and concealment of fraud proceeds.
3. **Mr. Wang**: Technical director of JPEX, responsible for the platform's technical maintenance and user data management, ensuring the platform operated normally and handling technical issues.
4. **Lin Zuo**: A well-known KOL who promoted JPEX, attracting a large number of investors through his significant influence. He frequently posted high-return investment success stories on social media, enhancing the platform's credibility.
5. **Chen Yi**: Another famous KOL, responsible for promoting JPEX through social media platforms, increasing its exposure and credibility, and attracting unsuspecting investors.

## Dialogue Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Investor Inquiry**
- Investor A: "Lin Zuo, I saw your recommendation for the JPEX platform. Does this JPC really have such high returns?"
- Lin Zuo: "Of course, I have invested a lot myself and the returns have been great. You should join quickly and not miss out on this opportunity!"

**Scenario 2: Investor Withdrawal Obstruction**
- Investor B: "Why is the withdrawal fee $999 and I can only withdraw $1,000? This doesn't make sense!"
- Customer Service: "This is our new policy to ensure platform security and fund liquidity. Please understand."

## Victim Analysis

Victims include 1,129 men and 512 women, aged between 18 and 49. Most are inexperienced investors attracted by the promise of high returns. Key characteristics of these victims include:

1. **Lack of Investment Experience**: Most victims lack a deep understanding of virtual asset investments and are easily drawn by promises of high returns.
2. **Predominantly Young Adults**: Victims are mainly young adults, aged 18 to 49, indicating this age group is more sensitive to emerging investment channels but weaker in risk identification.
3. **Blind Following**: Many victims learned about JPEX through social media and KOL promotions, blindly trusting so-called "investment experts" without thorough background checks or risk assessments.
4. **Eager to Get Rich**: Victims generally have a strong desire to get rich quickly, making them more susceptible to scams promising "high returns with low risk" while ignoring potential risks.

## Case Analysis

### 1. How did the fraudsters use new communication technologies to reach their targets?

Fraudsters used the following methods:

- **Social Media**: Fraudsters created attractive profiles on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, shared success stories, and directly contacted potential victims. In the JPEX case, KOLs like Lin Zuo and Chen Yi used their significant influence to endorse the platform, making it appear more legitimate.
- **Online Advertising**: Fraudsters placed targeted ads on Google, YouTube, and social media platforms. These ads typically used algorithms to target individuals interested in investments and high returns.
- **Instant Messaging Apps**: Apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat facilitated direct communication with potential victims. These apps allowed fraudsters to build trust through personalized messages and real-time interaction.
- **Fake Websites and Emails**: Professional-looking websites and phishing emails deceived individuals into believing they were interacting with legitimate entities. JPEX's website appeared professional and trustworthy, making it easier to deceive investors.

### 2. What are the common appeals used in this case?

Common appeals used by fraudsters include:

- **High Returns**: Promising high and guaranteed investment returns with minimal risk. For example, JPEX offered extremely high returns on JPC, attracting many inexperienced investors.
- **Authority and Trust**: Using endorsements from influential figures and presenting the scam as a credible and well-established business. Endorsements from Lin Zuo and Chen Yi added credibility to JPEX.
- **Scarcity and Urgency**: Creating a sense of urgency by offering limited-time deals or implying the investment opportunity is about to end, prompting potential victims to act quickly without thorough due diligence.
- **Exclusivity**: Suggesting the investment opportunity is exclusive and not available to the general public, making targets feel privileged and more inclined to participate.
- **Complexity**: Using complex terminology and investment strategies to confuse and impress targets, making the scam appear more legitimate.

### 3. What are the language characteristics of the scam content?

Language characteristics of the scam content include:

- **Persuasive and Convincing Tone**: Content is carefully crafted to be highly persuasive, presented in a convincing tone, and bolstered by authority and data to enhance credibility.
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Exploiting victims' emotions, including fear, greed, and the desire to get rich quickly, to entice them into making irrational investment decisions.
- **Technical Jargon**: Using complex financial and technical terms that victims may not fully understand, thereby increasing their trust in the scam.

### 4. How to prevent similar scams?

Methods to prevent similar scams include:

- **Education and Awareness**: Educating the public about common scam techniques and prevention strategies, raising their awareness and ability to identify risks.
- **Background Checks**: Conducting thorough background checks before making any investments, including verifying the platform's legitimacy and reviewing warnings from regulatory bodies like the SFC.
- **Skepticism of High Returns**: Staying rational and skeptical of promises of high returns with low risk. All investments carry risks, and high returns typically come with high risks.
- **Consulting Professional Advice**: Seeking advice and opinions from professional financial advisors or lawyers before making significant investments.
- **Maintaining Vigilance**: Staying vigilant and questioning unfamiliar investment opportunities, avoiding being swayed by immediate temptations.

## Conclusion

The JPEX fraud case highlights the high risks and complexities of virtual asset investments. Through carefully designed fraud tactics, JPEX successfully attracted a large number of investors, resulting in significant financial losses. This case emphasizes the importance of strengthening financial regulation and public education to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Investors should remain vigilant, invest cautiously, and avoid becoming the next victim.

## Background Story

Many victims are young people who have recently arrived in Hong Kong. They receive a call from a stranger. The scammer, through a series of carefully designed steps, gradually leads these victims into the scam, ultimately attempting to steal their money.

## Detailed Description of the Scam Process

### Initial Contact and Creating Fear

1. **Sudden Call from a Stranger**
   - The victim receives a call from a stranger. The call starts in Cantonese and then switches to Mandarin. The caller claims to be from the Hong Kong Immigration Department or the Hong Kong Communications Authority, informing the victim that their ID card has been misused on the mainland, involving criminal or financial crimes. The victim feels the situation is serious and becomes nervous immediately.

2. **Threatening and Creating a Tense Atmosphere**
   - The scammer, through a serious tone and detailed case description, further creates a tense atmosphere. For example, the scammer might say, "Your ID card has been misused on the mainland, involving a serious criminal case. To avoid affecting your normal life in Hong Kong, you need to cooperate with the investigation immediately." Such statements make the victim feel the urgency and the need to solve the problem quickly.

### Call Transfer and Professional Terminology

1. **Call Transfer to Fake Public Security Bureau**
   - The call is then transferred to someone claiming to be from the mainland Public Security Bureau. At this stage, scammer B, with professional terminology and a serious tone, further pressures the victim.

To verify your identity, please provide detailed personal information."

2. **Detailed Inquiry and Identity Verification**
   - Scammer B asks for detailed personal information from the victim, such as ID card number, home address, etc., and informs the victim of the specific illegal activities involving their ID card.

### Providing Fake Official Documents and Education

   - After gaining the victim's initial trust, the scammer provides fake official documents and pictures, even conducts so-called "education." These documents appear official and professional, such as fake police credentials, case records, etc. The scammer might also provide "educational" videos or articles on how to protect personal information to further lower the victim's guard.

2. **Applying Further Psychological Pressure**
   - The scammer continues to contact the victim by phone, claiming the case is very serious and must be resolved quickly. For example, the fake director might say, "Your case is extensive and very complicated. We suggest you take immediate action, or the consequences will be unimaginable."

This money is only temporarily held and will be fully refunded after the case is closed."
